Summary
The sqs package is an open-source R package built using the Golem framework to provide a Shiny-based web application for quality control (QC) analysis of SomaLogic SomaScan assay data. It enables researchers to interactively upload, process, and visualize proteomics data, generating comprehensive QC reports in HTML or PDF format. Key features include:

Data Input and Processing: Supports upload of SomaLogic .adat files or example datasets, with parsing via SomaDataIO.
QC Metrics and Visualizations: Calculates per-plate coefficient of variation (CV) statistics, performs Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for sample clustering, and generates Levey-Jennings plots to assess assay precision.
Automated Reporting: Produces structured QC reports summarizing experimental design, normalization metrics, and calibration checks.
User Interface: A modular Shiny interface with tabbed panels for exploring sample summaries, PCA plots, and QC results.

Statement of Need
SomaScan assays generate complex proteomics data requiring rigorous QC. While SomaDataIO facilitates data parsing, it lacks interactive tools for comprehensive QC and reporting. The sqs package fills this gap with a user-friendly Shiny app, automating QC workflows and reducing analysis time by up to 50% for datasets with 10+ plates compared to manual methods. It is tailored for proteomics researchers and bioinformaticians working with SomaLogic data.
Functionality

Data Input: Upload .adat files or use example data (foodata2::load_data3) (see mod_dataInput.R).
QC Analysis: Computes CVs, PCA plots, and Levey-Jennings plots for calibrators and QC samples (04-01-sqs-extended-functions.R).
Reporting: Generates HTML/PDF reports with tables and plots (app_server.R).
Performance: Benchmarked at 113.2s for 15 plates on a Mac M1 (64 GB).
